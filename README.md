## About The Project

<p> 
The accurate classification of images of flowers is essential to facilitate tasks such as botanical research, ecological studies as well as aesthetic appreciation. In order to achieve accurate categorisation of images of flowers, there is a need to leverage on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the ability to learn intricate patterns and features within images. By harnessing the potential of deep learning tools, creating a CNN model tailored for flower classification can potentially provide accurate identification of flowers while maintaining its scalability and adaptability to a myriad of flower species and environmental conditions. As such, understanding and building a CNN model will revolutionise the way we understand, study and appreciate the floral world while meeting the needs of many professionals who can leverage on this prototype to facilitate their research.
